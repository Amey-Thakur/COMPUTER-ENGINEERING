## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized index to all academic work completed during the Bachelor of Engineering program in Computer Engineering at [Terna Engineering College](https://ternaengg.ac.in/), affiliated with the [University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in/). Each linked repository contains lecture notes, laboratory assignments, project implementations, reference materials, and supplementary resources for the respective course.

**Purpose**: To provide organized access to educational content spanning eight semesters of undergraduate study, facilitating knowledge sharing and academic reference.

**Target Audience**: Students, educators, researchers, and professionals seeking reference materials in computer science and engineering disciplines.

---

## Motivation

Education is not a destination but a continuous journey. This repository represents my commitment to that philosophy—a deliberate effort to preserve, organize, and revisit the foundational knowledge acquired during my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering.

The creation of this archive stems from a fundamental belief: **true learning transcends the classroom and extends far beyond graduation**. As I navigate my professional career, I recognize that the concepts, methodologies, and problem-solving frameworks developed during these formative years remain invaluable. However, knowledge, when not actively maintained, fades. This repository serves as my intellectual foundation—a structured collection I can return to for relearning, reference, and reflection.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To capture and maintain the depth of understanding developed across eight semesters of rigorous study
- **Continuous Learning**: To create a resource that supports lifelong learning, enabling me to revisit fundamental principles as I encounter advanced challenges
- **Academic Integrity**: To document my authentic academic journey—every concept studied, every project implemented, every problem solved
- **Open Contribution**: To share these materials with the broader community, believing that knowledge grows when freely exchanged

This is more than a collection of files or a digital archive. It is a testament to four years of intellectual growth, a record of challenges overcome, and a foundation upon which future learning will be built. By making this work publicly available, I hope it serves not only my own continued education but also assists others on their learning journeys.

**Note**: All materials in this repository were created, compiled, and organized by me throughout my undergraduate program (2018-2022) as part of my coursework, laboratory assignments, and project implementations.
